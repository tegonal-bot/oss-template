Following the steps you should perform after cloning this template repository:

1. execute init.sh
2. adjust/check the TODO in this file
3. add a [new discussion category](https://github.com/tegonal/scala-commons/discussions/categories/new) 
   `Contributor Q&A` -- `Ask other contributors for help`
4. in order that the tegonal-bot pushes changes to its own fork (e.g. when executing cleanup.yml or gt-update.yml -- 
   see below for an explanation) and then create a normal PR you need to:
   1. [add the repository variable](https://github.com/tegonal/minimalist/settings/variables/actions/new)
      `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` with value tegonal-bot/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB
   2. login as tegonal-bot and then [fork the repository](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/fork)

5. Following a short introduction in the scripts already setup in this repository:
   1. before-pr.sh is executed in .github/workflows/quality-assurance.yml
      it currently executes scripts/cleanup-on-push-to-main.sh and scripts/run-shellcheck.sh 
      and should be extended by project specific tasks such as `sbt versionPolicyCheck` (e.g. in a scala project)
   2. cleanup-on-push-to-main.sh is executed in .github/workflows/cleanup.yml and is meant to cleanup after a PR.
      => put commands such as code formatting in it, code generation which is committed etc.
   3. run-shellcheck.sh checks that shellcheck doesn't find issues in scripts located in the scripts directory 
 
6. Following a short introduction in the workflows already setup in this repository:
   1. cleanup.yml => run after push on main and intended to cleanup after a PR. 
   2. gt-update.yml => run periodically, updates all files pulled in via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt)
   3. quality-assurance.yml => run for PR and pushes, checks that the code/script quality and such are ok and no TODOs
      are left open
      => you will typically add more jobs which run tests (sbt test or gradle build)

7. git commit -a -m "initialised"
8. As last step, delete this section and you are ready to start with your new OSS project
